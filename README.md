# Mobile Application Development Internship
Participating in the virtual internship as an app developer at Bharat Intern was an incredible journey that provided me with valuable insights into mobile app development and enhanced my skills in various areas.

# TASK 1: CALCULATOR
Task 1 involved building a simple calculator mobile app. It was an excellent opportunity for me to practice my mobile app development skills and apply fundamental programming concepts to create a functional calculator. I had the chance to design an 
intuitive user interface, implement arithmetic operations, and handle user input effectively. Developing the calculator app gave me hands-on experience in mobile app development and allowed me to understand the importance of user experience and error handling.
